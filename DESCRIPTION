Description: For use with NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) data. transfers() will create new variables to group separate episodes of care together if they are part of a larger hospital admission. This has been adapted from 'transfers.R' created by Timothy Dobbins, available here: https://github.com/timothydobbins/hospital-transfers-multipackage. transfers() is an adaptation of transfers.R from Timothy Dobbins. transfers_sas() is an adaptation of transfers.SAS, implemented in R. These two methods produce slightly different results, hence both functions are available depending on user preference
